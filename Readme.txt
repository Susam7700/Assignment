    # Build Automation Instructions for Node.js Application

## Prerequisites:
- Ensure that Node.js and npm are installed on your system.
- Make sure you have the appropriate permissions to run the build script.

## Steps to Run the Build Automation Script:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Open your terminal and run the following command to install all required dependencies:

npm install
2. **Run the Build Script**:
- On Linux/macOS:
  ```
  ./build.sh
  ```
- On Windows:
  ```
  build.bat
  ```

The build script will:
- Install dependencies
- Run the tests
- Create a build (you can modify the build step for your application as needed)
- Package your application into a `.zip` file for deployment

3. **Deployment**:
The final deployable package `deploy-package.zip` will be available in the root directory.

Enjoy your application deployment process!
Ensure that npm run build is defined in your package.json scripts. For example:
"scripts": {
  "test": "jest",
  "build": "echo 'Building application...'"
}
